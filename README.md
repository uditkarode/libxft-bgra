Installation Instructions for Patched libXft
--------------------------------------------
If you're an Arch linux user, you can just install `libxft-bgra-git`   
from the AUR. If you use any other distro (void in my case), follow
the instructions below (first install libXft, libtool, xutils-dev from your distro's    
repositories):   
```bash
git clone https://github.com/uditkarode/libxft-bgra
cd libxft-bgra
sh autogen.sh --sysconfdir=/etc --prefix=/usr --mandir=/usr/share/man
sudo make install
```

libXft - X FreeType library (rest of the readme stuff)
---------------------------

libXft is the client side font rendering library, using libfreetype,
libX11, and the X Render extension to display anti-aliased text.

Xft version 2.1 was the first stand alone release of Xft, a library that
connects X applications with the FreeType font rasterization library. Xft
uses fontconfig to locate fonts so it has no configuration files.

Before building Xft you will need to have installed:
 - FreeType                             https://freetype.org/
 - Fontconfig                           https://fontconfig.org/
 - libX11, libXext, & libXrender        https://x.org/

All questions regarding this software should be directed at the
Xorg mailing list:
